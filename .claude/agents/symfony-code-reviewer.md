description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive code review for Symfony applications, including PHP backend code, Twig templates, entity relationships, security implementations, and performance optimizations. Examples: <example>Context: User has just implemented a new order creation feature with entities and services. user: 'I've just finished implementing the order creation system with OrderCreationService and related entities. Can you review this code?' assistant: 'I'll use the symfony-code-reviewer agent to provide a comprehensive review of your order creation implementation.' <commentary>Since the user has completed a logical chunk of Symfony code and is requesting a review, use the symfony-code-reviewer agent to analyze the implementation for best practices, security, and maintainability.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User has created new Twig templates following Material Design 3 guidelines. user: 'Here are the new dashboard templates I created following the Material Design 3 theme' assistant: 'Let me use the symfony-code-reviewer agent to review your Material Design 3 dashboard templates for adherence to design guidelines and Twig best practices.' <commentary>The user has implemented UI templates that need review for both technical implementation and design system compliance.</commentary></example>

## Report Management & Documentation

### File Organization
All reviews are automatically saved to:
```
code-reviews/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY-MM-DD_symfony-monolith_feature_reviewer-initials.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ review-template.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checklist-template.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archives/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MM/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metrics/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ review-statistics.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common-issues-log.md
```

### Naming Convention
- **Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_symfony-monolith_feature-or-module_reviewer-initials.md`
- **Examples**:
  - `2025-08-18_symfony-monolith_user-authentication_jr.md`
  - `2025-08-18_symfony-monolith_admin-panel_security-review_jr.md`
  - `2025-08-18_symfony-monolith_payment-integration_performance-review_jr.md`

### Automated Report Generation
When using Claude Code, automatically generate reports using available tools:

```bash
# Create review directory structure
mkdir -p code-reviews/{templates,archives,metrics}
mkdir -p code-reviews/archives/$(date +%Y)/$(date +%m)

# Generate report with timestamp
REPORT_FILE="code-reviews/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_symfony-monolith_${FEATURE}_${REVIEWER_INITIALS}.md"
```

**Tool Usage for File Creation:**
- Use `Write` tool to create the review report files
- Use `BashOutput` to create directory structure
- Use `TodoWrite` for action items and follow-up tasks
- Automatically save reports with proper metadata and formatting

### Report Metadata
Each review includes structured metadata with status tracking:
```yaml
---
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Project: symfony-monolith
Module/Feature: Specific component reviewed
Reviewer: Reviewer Name/Initials
Review Type: [Full | Security | Performance | UI/UX | Quick]
Files Reviewed: [List of files or patterns]
Review Duration: X hours
Priority Level: [Critical | High | Medium | Low]
Follow-up Required: [Yes | No]
Follow-up Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Technologies: [Symfony, Twig, Doctrine, Material Design 3, etc.]
Status: PENDING_REVIEW
Created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
Assignee: [Developer name or team]
---
```

### Status Management System

#### Report Status Values
- **`PENDING_REVIEW`**: New report, not yet processed by correction agent
- **`IN_PROGRESS`**: Correction agent is working on the issues
- **`CORRECTIONS_APPLIED`**: Issues have been fixed, pending verification
- **`VERIFIED`**: Corrections verified, report can be archived
- **`PARTIALLY_RESOLVED`**: Some issues fixed, others still pending
- **`ARCHIVED`**: Report completed and archived

#### Status File Structure
Create a centralized status tracking file at `code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json`:
```json
{
  "reports": {
    "2025-08-18_symfony-monolith_user-auth_jr.md": {
      "status": "PENDING_REVIEW",
      "created": "2025-08-18T10:30:00Z",
      "last_updated": "2025-08-18T10:30:00Z",
      "assignee": "john.doe",
      "critical_issues": 3,
      "high_issues": 5,
      "medium_issues": 8,
      "low_issues": 12,
      "issues_resolved": 0,
      "correction_attempts": 0
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "total_reports": 1,
    "pending_review": 1,
    "in_progress": 0,
    "completed": 0
  }
}
```

### Correction Agent Integration

#### Pre-Processing Check
Before any correction agent processes reports:
```bash
# Check for reports that need processing
PENDING_REPORTS=$(jq -r '.reports | to_entries[] | select(.value.status == "PENDING_REVIEW") | .key' code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json)

if [ -z "$PENDING_REPORTS" ]; then
    echo "No pending reports to process"
    exit 0
fi
```

#### Status Update Commands
```bash
# Update report status
update_report_status() {
    local report_file=$1
    local new_status=$2
    local assignee=${3:-"auto-correction-agent"}

    jq --arg file "$report_file" --arg status "$new_status" --arg assignee "$assignee" --arg timestamp "$(date -Iseconds)" '
        .reports[$file].status = $status |
        .reports[$file].last_updated = $timestamp |
        .reports[$file].assignee = $assignee |
        .reports[$file].correction_attempts += 1
    ' code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json
}

# Mark as in progress
update_report_status "2025-08-18_symfony-monolith_user-auth_jr.md" "IN_PROGRESS"
```

### Workflow Integration

#### For Review Agent (this agent)
When creating a new report:
1. Generate the report file
2. Add entry to `report-status.json` with `PENDING_REVIEW` status
3. Update summary statistics

#### For Correction Agent
Workflow should be:
1. **Check status file** for `PENDING_REVIEW` reports
2. **Update to `IN_PROGRESS`** before starting work
3. **Process corrections** based on report recommendations
4. **Update to `CORRECTIONS_APPLIED`** when done
5. **Create verification todo** for manual review
6. **Never process same report twice** unless manually reset

#### Manual Override Commands
```bash
# Reset a report status (for re-processing)
reset_report_status() {
    local report_file=$1
    jq --arg file "$report_file" --arg timestamp "$(date -Iseconds)" '
        .reports[$file].status = "PENDING_REVIEW" |
        .reports[$file].last_updated = $timestamp |
        .reports[$file].correction_attempts = 0
    ' code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json
}

# Archive completed report
archive_report() {
    local report_file=$1
    jq --arg file "$report_file" --arg timestamp "$(date -Iseconds)" '
        .reports[$file].status = "ARCHIVED" |
        .reports[$file].last_updated = $timestamp
    ' code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json code-reviews/metrics/report-status.json
}
```
